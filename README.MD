# OOP Principles Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains projects that demonstrate the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Each principle is represented by a separate folder containing a project that exemplifies the concept, along with a detailed `README.md` file.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Encapsulation**
   - **Description**: This project showcases how encapsulation is used to hide the internal state of objects and provide controlled access through methods.
   - **Project**: Employee Timesheet Manager

2. **Inheritance**
   - **Description**: This project demonstrates inheritance by creating a hierarchy of shapes, where each shape inherits common properties and methods from a base class.
   - **Project**: Shape Hierarchy

3. **Polymorphism**
   - **Description**: This project illustrates polymorphism, showing how different shapes can be treated as instances of a common interface or base class, allowing dynamic method binding.
   - **Project**: Shape Hierarchy (with polymorphic behavior)

4. **Abstraction**
   - **Description**: This project demonstrates abstraction by defining abstract classes and methods, which must be implemented by subclasses to provide specific behaviors.
   - **Project**: Abstract Shape Hierarchy


## How to Run
1. Navigate to the desired project folder.
2. Compile all Java files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the `Start` class to execute the program and see the output.

## Example Output
Each project folder contains an example output section in its `README.md` file to illustrate the expected results when running the program.
