# Understanding Encapsulation

## What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that work on that data into a single unit, or class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some parts of an object, helping to prevent misuse and maintain data integrity.

## How Does Encapsulation Work?
Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:

- **Private**: Data is accessible only within the class itself.
- **Protected**: Data is accessible within the class and by subclasses.
- **Public**: Data is accessible from anywhere.

Access modifiers help protect the internal state of an object while allowing controlled access through methods.

## Rules of Encapsulation
1. **Use Access Modifiers**: Use `private`, `protected`, or `public` to control visibility.
2. **Private Data Members**: Keep class attributes private to protect data.
3. **Getter/Setter Methods**: Provide public methods to access and modify private data.
4. **Controlled Access**: Ensure data is accessed through methods with validation or logic.

## Why is Encapsulation Important?
- **Data Hiding**: Keeps object data hidden from the outside, preventing accidental changes.
- **Flexibility**: You can change internal data structures without affecting external code.
- **Better Organization**: Keeps related data and methods together, making code easier to manage.
- **Controlled Access**: Ensures data is modified safely and consistently.

## Conclusion
Encapsulation helps create more reliable and maintainable software by protecting the internal state of objects and allowing safe interactions with them through controlled methods.
